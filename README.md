# :taxi: Verbal Explanations of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Forecasting :car:

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) built using Deep Neural Network (DNN) models offer an effective solution for handling short-term traffic flow, which greatly assists drivers, travellers or public security and safety in their decision-making. In particular, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gained popularity as a powerful tool for effectively modelling spatio-temporal dependencies in diverse real-world urban applications, including intelligent transportation and public safety. However, the black-box nature of these models prevents a true understanding of the results and a trustworthy adoption by their users.

The research field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this concern by developing systems that help users trust non-transparent AI. Non-expert ITS users are primarily interested in the non-technical reasons behind model predictions. Hence, leveraging Natural Language Generation (NLG), verbal descriptions of the reasons behind model outcomes are a peculiar tool to provide an easy and clear illustration of the process.

This work focuses on developing an XAI system to explain short-term speed forecasts in traffic networks obtained from STGNNs. The primary emphasis lies in explaining the reasons behind predicted traffic congestions or free flows. Key information justifying these predictions is extracted from the input traffic network in the form of a significant subgraph. The information of the subgraph is finally summarized and it is then converted into text using a template-based approach.

For more detailed informations about the used functions, look into the corresponding docstrings inside the python files, inside the `src` folder.

## Description
This work aims to develop a new *XAI* system tailored for non-technical users, explaining short-term speed predictions in traffic networks generated by a *STGNN*. It focuses on clarifying the reasons behind both traffic congestion and free flow.

 The STGNNs used in the experiment are built following the paper [Traffic Flow Prediction via Spatial Temporal Graph Neural Network](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366423.3380186). Two extensive real world datasets are used for the experiment, namely *METR-LA* and *PEMS_BAY* previously used in [Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926).

<div align="center">

</div>

To achieve this goal, the system uses a transparent and easily comprehensible *post-hoc model inspection* explainer to provide explanations which can be more easily conveyed to the target users and which consider both the local and global scope of explanations. These explanations are performed on extracted events in the predicted output and they take the visual form of an *important subgraph* within the input traffic network data, highlighting information crucial for the forecasts. The global aspect of the search is obtained by cutting the input graph in a subset according to *traffic laws* measuring correlations between input and output nodes. The obtained subgraph is then furtherly pruned by a localized *Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)*, obtaining a refined explanation for the output event. The obtained refined subgraph is finally divided in clusters illustrating events that led to the outcome. The explainer takes inspiration from [Explaining Temporal Graph Models through an Explorer-Navigator Framework](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BR_ZhvcYbGJ), but deeply modifies its implementation.

</div>

These visual explanations are then enriched by their translation into verbal descriptions to better align with the *social process of understanding*. The system finally summarizes essential data from the extracted subgraph into clear, straightforward text, using a simple *data-to-sequence template-based method* to ensure easy comprehension.

* `distances_la_2012.csv` and rename it to `distances_metr_la.csv`
* `graph_sensor_locations.csv` and rename it to `graph_sensor_locations_metr_la.csv`

and copy them in the folder `./data/metr-la/raw`.

Furthermore, the user should download the following files:
* `pems-bay-h5`
* `adj_mx_bay.pkl` and rename it to `adj_mx_pems_bay.pkl` 
* `distances_bay_2017.csv` and rename it to `distances_pems_bay.csv`

and copy them in the folder `./data/pems-bay/raw`.

### Data Analysis
To perform the analysis of *METR-LA* run the notebook [00 Data Analysis on the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/00%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb).

While to analyse *PEMS-BAY* run the notebook
[00 Data Analysis on the PeMS-Bay Dataset](notebooks/00%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb).

### STGNNs Training and Predictions
To train the *STGNN* on METR-LA and perform its prediction on the training validation ad test sets run the notebook
[01 Building a STGNN for the Metr-LA dataset](<notebooks/01 Building a STGNN for the Metr-LA dataset.ipynb>).

To perform the same process on PEMS-BAY run [01 Building a STGNN for the PeMS-Bay dataset](notebooks/01%20Building%20a%20STGNN%20for%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20dataset.ipynb).

### Run the Explainer
To run the explainer on the predictions of METR-LA:
- Firstly, extract predicted events by running [02 Clustering the Predictions of the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/02%20Clustering%20the%20Predictions%20of%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb).
- Then, run the explainer on the notebook [03 Monte Carlo Tree Search on the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/03%20Monte%20Carlo%20Tree%20Search%20on%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb).
- Finally cluster the explanations into input events through [04 Clustering the Explanations of the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/04%20Clustering%20the%20Explanations%20of%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb).

For what concerns PEMS-BAY, the same process can be obtained by running in order the following notebooks:
- [02 Clustering the Predictions of the PeMS-Bay Dataset](notebooks/02%20Clustering%20the%20Predictions%20of%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb).
- [03 Monte Carlo Tree Search on the PeMS-Bay Dataset](notebooks/03%20Monte%20Carlo%20Tree%20Search%20on%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb).
- [04 Clustering the Explanations of the PeMS-Bay Dataset](notebooks/04%20Clustering%20the%20Explanations%20of%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb).

### Verbal Translation
To translate the explanations of METR-LA into text narratives run the notebook.

[06 Verbal Explanations on the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/06%20Verbal%20Explanations%20on%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb).

To perform the same process on PEMS-BAY run [06 Verbal Explanations on the PeMS-Bay Dataset](notebooks/06%20Verbal%20Explanations%20on%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb).

In order to visualize an explained instance of METR-LA or PEMS-BAY run [07 Visualizing an Explained Instance of the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/07%20Visualizing%20an%20Explained%20Instance%20of%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb) or [07 Visualizing an Explained Instance of the PeMS-Bay Dataset](<notebooks/07%20Visualizing%20an%20Explained%20Instance%20of%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb>) respectively.

Note, the street and kilometrages for the nodes used in the verbal narratives have been extracted through notebooks [05 Fetching the Nodes Locations on the Metr-LA Dataset](notebooks/05%20Fetching%20the%20Nodes%20Locations%20on%20the%20Metr-LA%20Dataset.ipynb) and [05 Fetching the Nodes Locations on the PeMS-Bay Dataset](notebooks/05%20Fetching%20the%20Nodes%20Locations%20on%20the%20PeMS-Bay%20Dataset.ipynb>) respectively. Since the node geolocation results are not deterministic, refer to [link](data/metr-la/structured/node_locations.pkl) and [link](data/pems-bay/structured/node_locations.pkl) for the extracted geolocations of the nodes used in the experiment.
