        "In this notebook the explanations of the predicted events of the *STGNN* on the *PeMS-Bay* dataset are computed by means of an *Explainer*. The explainer is an MCTS algorithm that performs a localized search on the input graph of the instance to be explained. It returns the important subgraph which serves as the explanation of the predicted selected event outputed by the STGNN. The search space is cut by a transparent *global heuristic* that exploits traffic domain-specific characteristics and limits the search on a subgraph of the input graph composed of the top scoring nodes according to the global heuristic. The explainer is inspired by the paper *Explaining temporal graph models through an explorer-navigator framework* <a name=\"cite_paper\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#note_paper).\n",
